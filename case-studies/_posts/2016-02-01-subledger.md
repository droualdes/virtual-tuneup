### Organization

Subledger is an Internet startup that built is a set of powerful APIs that allow developers to build the accounting part of their app quickly.

### Problem

Subledgerâ€™s website needed to be more professional. The blog, created in a CMS (Content Management System), was too difficult to use.

### Solution

Virtual TuneUp redesigned the website with a cleaner and more professional design. The site was coded using Bootstrap, an HTML5, CSS3, and JS framework for developing responsive mobile-first websites. Jekyll, a static website and blog generator was also used, which eliminated the need for a CMS.

The user interface and user experience dramatically improved. The site now looks great on all devices including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. Site modifications and blog management became fast and straightforward.
