### Organization

Bayside Garden Center is a nursery in Tiburon, California.

### Problem

Bayside Garden Center wanted a simple website.

### Solution

Virtual TuneUp designed an ultra-simple and persuasive one-page responsive website. The site's main feature was a beautiful Bayside Garden Center logo and seasonal coupons which were inexpensive to update as only a few lines of code needed to be updated. Bayside's address, phone number, email, hours of operation, and social media information were also listed. Being a responsive website meant that it looks great on phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

Virtual TuneUp also built a social media presence for Bayside Garden Center. It included Facebook, Pinterest, and Yelp presences. The non-tech-savvy owners were trained on how to update and maintain their newfound online presences.
