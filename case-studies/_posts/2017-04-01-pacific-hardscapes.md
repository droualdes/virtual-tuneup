### Organization

Pacific Hardscapes is a construction startup doing business in the San Francisco Bay area.

### Problem

Pacific Hardscape opened its doors in 2015. They wanted an extensive website to promote their company.

### Solution

Virtual TuneUp developed a clean and professional website with over 100 pages in total. The site featured an extensive product catalog section that allowed customers to pick the product, style, and color. A social media presence on Facebook and Yelp was also created. Portfolio photos were loaded on these sites for promotional purposes.

The site is at <a href="http://www.pacifichardscapes.com" target="_blank" alt="Pacific Hardscapes">www.pacifichardscapes.com</a>.
