### Organization

Sterling Consulting is a leader in the San Francisco Bay Area providing exceptional project and marketing consultants for a diverse range of industries: financial services, healthcare, biotech, insurance, tech, energy, education, and non-profits.

### Problem

Sterlingâ€™s web site was designed years ago and built for viewing on a computer only. Visitors had a poor browsing experience when visiting the site with a mobile device, such as a phone or tablets, as they need to zoom in and out to view content.

### Solution

Virtual TuneUp redesigned the website with a modern and professional look. The site was designed to be responsive, which means it adapts to the viewing device and looks great on phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. The site was coded using Bootstrap, an HTML5, CSS3, and JS framework for developing responsive mobile-first websites. Jekyll, a static website and blog generator was also used, which eliminated the need for a CMS.

The user interface and user experience improved dramatically. Site modifications and blog management became fast and straightforward.
