### Organization

The Information Technology department at the City of San Rafael serves about 400 employees spread throughout the city in all departments including Fire, Police, and Public Works.

### Problem

The IT department needed a performance boost in the area of productivity, efficiency, and resolution of IT issues.

### Solution

Virtual TuneUp identified process, performance, and communication flaws. New policies were developed. Streamlined procedures were implemented. Training was provided to department members. A Zendesk.com ticketing and dispatching system was installed and configured, which served 400 employees in all departments. The foundation for dramatically improved interdepartmental communications was laid out. Workflows for IT equipment recycling and waste streams were also developed which complied with Homeland Security, City, and State guidelines.
